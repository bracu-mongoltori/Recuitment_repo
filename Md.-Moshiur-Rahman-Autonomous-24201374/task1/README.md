# Grid-Based Path Planning Benchmark

This project implements and benchmarks **Dijkstra's Algorithm** and **A\*** for path planning on a 2D occupancy grid.

---

## Features
- Pathfinding on `.csv` grid maps (0 = free, 1 = obstacle)
- Supports Dijkstra and A* (Manhattan)
- Benchmarking: time, path length, success rate
- Visualization using `matplotlib`
- Output results in terminal and `benchmark_summary.csv`

---

## Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas


## RUN 

```bash

python main.py


it will run the algorithms , visualization and benchmark
