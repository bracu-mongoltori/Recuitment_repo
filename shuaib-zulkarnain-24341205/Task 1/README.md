# Grid Map Path Planning

This project benchmarks two path planning algorithms — Dijkstra's and A* — on different types of 2D occupancy grid maps: sparse map, maze map, and cost field map.

## Contents

- `Grid Map Path Planning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing the algorithms and recording benchmark results.
- `Grid_Map_Report.md`: Report in markdown format including implementation details, results, and analysis.
- `Grid_Map_Report.pdf`: PDF version of the report.

## Run Instructions

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Execute all cells to generate paths and benchmark results.
3. View `Grid_Map_Report.md` or `Grid_Map_Report.pdf` for analysis and findings.

## Benchmark Summary

- Average runtime and path length for Dijkstra and A*.
- Performance analysis across different grid types.
- Robustness and success rate comparison.
