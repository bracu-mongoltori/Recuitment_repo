## Overview

This package demonstrates ROS 2 fundamentals using the `turtlesim` simulator. It includes:

- A node that drives the turtle in a **figure-eight** pattern and logs its pose.
- A service node to **toggle the pen (trace)** on or off.
- A launch file to start all components together.

This project showcases core ROS 2 concepts including publishers, subscribers, services, custom launch files, and modular Python nodes.

## Build Instructions:

Navigate to your workspace:
<pre>
    cd ~/ros2_ws
</pre>
Build the package:
<pre>colcon build --packages-select turtle_control</pre>
Source your workspace(depending on your shell):
<pre>source install/setup.bash</pre>
or,If you are on zsh shell:
<pre>source install/setup.zsh</pre>

## Running the Demo
Launch turtlesim and your custom nodes:
<pre>ros2 launch turtle_control bringup.launch.py</pre>

Toggle the pen (trace) ON:
<pre>ros2 service call /toggle_trace std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: true}"</pre>
Toggle the pen (trace) OFF:
<pre>ros2 service call /toggle_trace std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: false}"</pre>

Notes:
- Ensure all dependencies are installed and your ROS 2 environment is properly sourced according to your shell.
- Replace maintainer information in package.xml and setup.py with your own details.
- For development, consider using colcon build --symlink-install for faster iteration.
